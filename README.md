# Maze Solver

The Maze Solver is a Python program that finds a solution to a maze using a breadth-first search algorithm. This program takes a maze represented as a text file, with a start point ('A') and a goal point ('B'), and finds a path from the start to the goal while avoiding obstacles represented as walls ('â–ˆ').
